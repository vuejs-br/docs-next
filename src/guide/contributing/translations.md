# Translations

Vue has spread across the globe, with the core team being in at least half a dozen different timezones. [The forum](https://forum.vuejs.org/) includes 7 languages and counting and many of our docs have [actively-maintained translations](https://github.com/vuejs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=vuejs.org). We'are very proud of Vue's international reach, but we can do even better.

## Can we start translating Vue 3 docs?

At this time, the Vue 3 docs are still in beta and subject to changes at any time. As a result, we would caution against any significant work since we are still collecting feedback and rewriting it as needed. When the docs are in release candidate phase, we will make sure to make an announcement so you can get started!

## How can I get involved with translations?

The best way to get started is to check out [this pinned issue for Vuejs.org](https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org/issues/2015) that contains active discussions on the various initiatives happening in the community.
